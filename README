Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
First, you have to compile cntlm. Using the Makefile, this should be very easy:

$ make

Cntlm does not require any dynamic libraries and there are no dependencies you
have to satisfy before compilation, except for libpthreads. This library is
required for all threaded applications and is very likely to be part of your
system already. Next, install cntlm onto your system like so:

$ make install

This includes the main binary and the man page (see "man cntlm"). Default
target prefix is /usr/local; that is /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/share/man.
Should you want to install cntlm to a different location, change the PREFIX
variable:

$ make install PREFIX=/usr


Architectures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you are building cntlm on a non-Linux/i386 platform, you have to deal with
the endianness of the host machine. Default is to build for little endian
(i386, ia64, amd64, alpha, s390, mipsel, vax). Alternatively, you can choose
to build for big endian (powerpc, m68k, sparc, mips) - this includes AIX on
pSeries. Specification of the proper endianness has to be done for all modules.
Make sure all of them are compiled with this option:

$ make clean
$ make CFLAGS=-DNTLM_BIG_ENDIAN

With incorrect endianness specification cntlm compiles seemingly OK, but any
network communication will malfunction (most notably NTLM authentication).


Compilers
~~~~~~~~~
Cntlm was tested and successfully compiles with GCC. Other compilers might work
for you (then again, they might not).
