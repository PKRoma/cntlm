 CNTLM - Authenticating NTLMv2 Web Proxy for Corporate Environment
 Copyright (C) 2007-2012 David Kubicek


 ===================================
 IF YOU USE CNTLM, CONSIDER DONATING
 ===================================
 That's all I have in the way of supporting any further development,
 performing involved analyses of users' network issues, bug fixing,
 implementing new features and keeping the AWK.cz VPS and file servers
 up and running.
 The names of any and all significant benefactors will be immortalized
 on Cntlm's home page and in the PDF manual forever.
 This was originally a project about freedom, created for the greater
 good alone, but my current situation changes many things and I may
 even be forced to close-source it (against every fiber of my being).
